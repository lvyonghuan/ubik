<p align="center">To honor Philip K. Dick</p>

<p align="center">I am Ubik. Before the universe was, I am. I made the suns. I made the worlds. I created
the lives and the places they inhabit; I move them here, I put them there. They go as I say,
they do as I tell them. I am the word and my name is never spoken, the name which no
one knows. I am called Ubik, but that is not my name. I am. I shall always be.</p>
